## Introduction
This repository holds code for my experimentations with different Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies.

Start by cloning this repository with the following commands to access the code for all the different AI / Machine Learning algorithms covered:

```
mkdir $HOME/dev
cd $HOME/dev
git clone https://github.com/robipozzi/robipozzi-ai
```

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns.

Unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning algorithms are given labeled training to learn the relationship between the input and the outputs.

### Linear Regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

It is a statistical method used in data science and machine learning for predictive analysis.

### Classification and Logistic Regression
A classification problem in machine learning is one in which a class label is anticipated for a specific example of input data. 

Problems with categorization include the following: 
* Give an example and indicate whether it is spam or not. 
* Identify a handwritten character as one of the recognized characters.

Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not and diagnosing diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning in artificial intelligence is a type of machine learning that learns from data without human supervision.

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised machine learning models are given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any explicit guidance or instruction.
